# This file uses the proto output_buffer format defined by google.
#   For now it contains a minimal setup for compiling with
#   avr-gcc on a linux platform. You might have to adjust
#   the toolpath values to point to the executables provided by
#   your system. The same is true for the include path.
#   These wiki articles should be helpful in case you want to
#   setup a toolchain that uses tools from a remote repo:

# From here on the important stuff happens.
# We tell bazel where to find all the tools that it needs
# for the build process. Instead of using the binaries
# provided by the OS here one could refer to executables
# residing inside other bazel projects. This way the toolchain
# could be decoupled from the Operating system.
# An example for this is given in the links at the top.
